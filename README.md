🔹 Problem Statement:
        The bank wants to analyse its loan portfolio to understand loan performance across regions, time, home-ownership, purpose, and customer risk factors such as interest rate and DTI.
The raw loan data was unstructured and needed cleaning, modelling, and dashboarding to generate useful business   insights.

 
🔹 Steps Followed:

1. Explored raw dataset and understood domain metrics (loan status, interest rate, DTI).

2. Loaded data into My SQL  and performed data cleaning.

3. Wrote SQL queries to extract KPIs such as total applications, funded amount, average interest rate, and good vs bad loan ratio.

4. Connected SQL to Power BI and imported cleaned data.

5. Performed transformations in Power Query, created a Date table, and built data model relationships.

6. Designed Power BI dashboard with cards, trend charts, maps, slicers, and drill-downs.

7. Added interactive features like navigation buttons, slicers, and field parameters.


🔹 Key Insights:

Loan applications and funded amount vary significantly across states and months.

High DTI and high interest rate customers show higher default risk.

Certain loan purposes (e.g., small business) have higher bad-loan rates.

Home-ownership status influences loan performance.

The interactive dashboard allows stakeholders to filter by region, purpose, home-ownership, and time for deeper insights.


🔹 Outcome:
An interactive, user-friendly Power BI dashboard helping the bank identify risk patterns, 
customer segments,and performance trends to support data-driven decisions.
